##Project Name: VPC

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS is a logically isolated network within the AWS cloud where you can define and control various network resources. It enables you to launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other services, in a virtual network that you define.

With a VPC, you get complete control over your network environment, including:

IP address range: You can define the IP address range (CIDR block) for the VPC.

Subnets: Divide the VPC into multiple subnets, which are essentially smaller network segments. You can have both public and private subnets.

Route tables: Define routing rules for network traffic to travel between subnets, the internet, or other networks.

Internet Gateway: Allows resources in your VPC to communicate with the internet. Typically, a VPC will have an Internet Gateway (IGW) attached to allow public subnet resources to access the internet.
NAT Gateway/Instance: Allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet, while preventing incoming traffic.

Security: You can configure Security Groups (stateful firewalls) and Network ACLs (stateless firewalls) to control inbound and outbound traffic at both the instance level and subnet level.

Peering Connections: You can connect multiple VPCs using VPC peering to allow resources in different VPCs to communicate.

VPN and Direct Connect: Connect your on-premises network to your VPC through VPN or AWS Direct Connect.

Key VPC Components:
Subnets: Networks within your VPC that define the availability zones where resources are placed (e.g., private, public, or isolated subnets).

Internet Gateway: Allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.

Elastic IP (EIP): Public IP address that can be associated with an instance or a network interface in your VPC.

Route Tables: Define routes for how traffic flows within and outside the VPC.

NAT Gateway: Allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet.

VPC Peering: Enables communication between two VPCs in different regions or the same region.

Security Groups and Network ACLs: Control access to resources by specifying rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
