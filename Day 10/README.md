# CloudFront
## What is CloudFront?
CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) web service from Amazon. It integrates with all AWS services and allows you to deliver content like images, videos, applications, and APIs quickly, with low latency and high transfer speeds.

## Benefits of CloudFront:

### Faster Content Delivery:
CloudFront delivers content to users from its cache/edge locations quickly, without latency, and at high transfer speeds.

### Global Reach:
CloudFront is located in various regions worldwide, delivering your content to users from the nearest location with minimal delay.

### Security:
It provides high security for your content with features like DDoS protection and SSL/TLS encryption.

### Cost-Effective:
It charges you only when data is transferred, making it cost-effective for businesses of all sizes.

## Setting Up CloudFront on AWS
Now, let's get our hands dirty and set up CloudFront on AWS!

### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon S3.
Create a new bucket to store your website content.

### Step 2: Upload Content to the S3 Bucket
Upload images, videos, or any other content you want to serve through CloudFront to your S3 bucket.

### Step 3: Create a CloudFront Distribution
Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to CloudFront.
Click "Create Distribution."
Choose whether you want to deliver a web application or content (like images and videos).
Configure your settings, such as the origin (your S3 bucket), cache behaviors, and security settings.
Click "Create Distribution" to set up CloudFront.

### Step 4: Update Website URLs
Once your CloudFront distribution is deployed (it may take a few minutes), you'll get a CloudFront domain name (e.g., d1a2b3c4def.cloudfront.net).
Replace the URLs of your website content with the CloudFront domain name.
That's it! Your content is now being delivered through CloudFront.
