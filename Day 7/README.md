# CloudWatch
CloudWatch is a powerful observability tool in AWS and a managed service. It helps collect metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources, applications, and managed servers.

You can set alarms for your resources to send out notifications. It allows you to monitor performance and health, analyze application logs, and troubleshoot issues.

## Key Features of CloudWatch

* Metrics: Tracks your application and AWS resources (like EC2 instances, RDS databases, Lambda functions, etc.) and managed servers' metrics (such as CPU utilization, memory usage, disk usage, and others).

* Logs: Allows AWS services, applications, and servers to send log streams to CloudWatch for analysis and troubleshooting.

* Alarms: You can create alarms for AWS resources and applications based on specific requirements to send notifications when issues occur.

* Dashboard: Create customized dashboards to visualize all AWS services in one place for easy understanding.
